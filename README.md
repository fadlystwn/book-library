# Book Project

Welcome to the Book Project repository! This project aims to create a book library application.

## Getting Started

Before running the server, make sure to set up your environment variables. Create a file named `env.local` in the root directory of the project and add the following line:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API='https://my-json-server.typicode.com/cutamar/mock'
```

This variable specifies the API endpoint for fetching book data.

### Running the Development Server

To start the development server, use one of the following commands:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

After running the server, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your web browser to view the application.

### Production Deployment

For production deployment, the application is hosted on Vercel. You can access the deployed version of the application by following this link:
